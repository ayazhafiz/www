My personal site, written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org),
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
(amongst other languages).

The repo is reset to an initial commit after each 100 commits, or after major
feature (X.0.0) introduction. This is done because big numbers scare or because
I am not an image of my past, whichever sounds better.
There has been __1__ reset so far.
